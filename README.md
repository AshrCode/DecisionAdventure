# Decision Adventure

A back-end for a simple web application which allows a player to choose their own
adventure by picking from multiple choices in order to progress to the next set of choices,
until they get to one of the endings. You should be able to persist the player’s choices and in
the end, show the steps they took to get to the end of the game.
The application will have a few pages.
1. A “Create an Adventure” page which lets creators design the adventure.
2. A “Take an Adventure” page where the users make their choices and get to the end
and persist the path they took.
3. A “Decision tree” page that shows the result of the adventure with highlighted choices
that the user has made in their story.
